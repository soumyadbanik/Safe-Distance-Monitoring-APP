# Safe-Distance-Monitoring-APP
An web app for monitoring safe distance on [Stanford Drone Dataset](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/uav_data/). Trained on Darknet YOLOv4 for performing small object detection and then tracked only Pedestrians and Bikers using DeepSORT. Here violation index is set(in #pixels) after several trials and measured the number of total violations in a Stanford drone video. Please checkout my [object-detection-on-aerial-videos](https://github.com/soumyadbanik/object-detection-on-aerial-videos) repo for performing multiobject detection on this dataset. Here a larger dataset is used than before.
